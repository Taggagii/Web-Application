        The weather app was out first foray into an application that actually did something. It sends the user's desired
        location to an "API" which is really just web scraping from Google's weather page. The resultant temperature is
        saved to the site's database, and then all temperature listings are displayed on the page. Users can also delete
        readings they no longer need.
