# Flask App Test

This is a first test of a web application using Flask.
We've currently got a weather app and poll app essentially complete.

We have attempted to implement login but due to lack of testing time on the server we do not know if this function is fully functional yet. 

We are attempting to use sessions to allow multiple users to access and use the site separately at the same time
